# Casino Spin ðŸŽ°

**Casino Spin** is a mini game inspired by a slot machine, where you can test your luck right in your browser. By clicking the "Spin!" button, you can either win a jackpot or face a loss. The outcome is completely random, and the result is displayed as a message showing whether you won or lost.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the page structure.
- **CSS** for a stylish and simple interface.
- **JavaScript (async/await)** to handle asynchronous operations and simulate the slot machine.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Click on the "Spin!" button to start the game.
3. Check if you won a jackpot or need to try again.
